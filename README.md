    - **CLEAR COMMunication (CLEARCOMM):** Designed, implemented, and optimized an encoder-decoder pair for the vessel communication, and utilized  asynchronous streams to handle bursty bit errors that arise.

    - **SAFEty of the autonomous Vessel (SAFE-V):** Built and optimized safety analysis algorithms, significantly enhancing the vessel's operational reliability.
- Technologies: Rust, Cargo (build tool), Async programming (async_std), Nalgebra crate, Markov chains, Fault tree analysis.

3. **Edge Detection**

- Description: 

    - Developed an edge detection algorithm to identify boundaries in grayscale images.

    - Applied Gaussian blur using convolution to reduce noise, calculated gradient magnitudes from image derivatives, and implemented thresholding to classify edge pixels.

    - Managed file I/O operations for reading and writing Portable Graymap (PGM) image files.

- Technologies: C, Convolution, Gaussian kernel, Image processing, PGM (Portable GrayMap), Command line interface (CLI), Mathematical operations, Dynamic memory allocation

4. **Page Rank**

- Description:
    - Implemented the PageRank algorithm to compute node weights in directed graphs utilizing random surfer simulation and Markov chain-based computation.

    - Developed functions for graph parsing, processing, and statistical analysis.

    - Developed CLI options to handle command line parameters, computation modes, and output types.
- Technologies: C, Markov chain, Random simulation, Graph theory, Probability vectors, Command line interface (CLI).

5. **Route Planner**

- Description: 

    - Built a route planner application that plans optimal routes for cars, bikes, and pedestrians. 

    - Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A* algorithm to improve performance on large maps.

    - Designed a graph data structure to process map data from custom Node And Edge (NAE) files.

- Technologies: Java, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, PriorityQueue, Graph theory.

6. **Software Engineering Projects**

- Description: 

    - **Configurable Database**: Designed and implemented a configurable database, utilizing 3 different techniques: runtime parameters, decorators, traits and mixins, to learn about Scala's advanced language features.

- Technologies: Scala, Eclipse IDE, Decorator pattern, Traits, Class composition, Mixins, Type checking, SAT solver (CafeSAT), sbt.

7. **Winter der Toten**

- Description: 
    - Collaborated with a team of 4 to design and develop a cooperative survival strategy board game.

    - Programmed core game mechanics, including game procedure, character actions, resource card management, and crisis handling, along with server-client communication.

    - Planned and designed a scalable, maintainable game architecture using OOP principles, enabling future expansions such as new card types, commands, and game events.

    - Utilized JUnit to design unit and integration tests to ensure game accuracy and reliability.

- Technologies: Java, Gradle, Git, IntelliJ, PMD, SpotBugs, UML Diagrams, Client-Server Architecture, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests.
