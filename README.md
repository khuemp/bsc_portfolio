    - Applied Gaussian blur using convolution to reduce noise, calculated gradient magnitudes from image derivatives, and implemented thresholding to classify edge pixels.

    - Managed file I/O operations for reading and writing Portable Graymap (PGM) image files.

- Technologies: C, Convolution, Gaussian kernel, Image processing, PGM (Portable GrayMap), Command line interface (CLI), Mathematical operations, Dynamic memory allocation

4. **Page Rank**

- Description:
    - Implemented the PageRank algorithm to compute node weights in directed graphs utilizing random surfer simulation and Markov chain-based computation.

    - Developed functions for graph parsing, processing, and statistical analysis.

    - Developed CLI options to handle command line parameters, computation modes, and output types.
- Technologies: C, Markov chain, Random simulation, Graph theory, Probability vectors, Command line interface (CLI).

5. **Robot Motion Planning**
- Description:
    - Developed a PDDL-based motion planning system for robots navigating a map with locked locations and fuel constraints. 

    - Modeled robot actions (move, take-key, drop-key, unlock) to handle key collection, location unlocking, and fuel management while adhering to constraints like single-robot occupancy and key-specific unlocking.
    
    - Leveraged predefined predicates in PDDL to track states and ensure efficient goal achievement, enabling robots to move specific keys to target locations within limited fuel.

- Technologies: PDDL, AI Planning, Motion Planning, Robot Navigation, Predicate Logic, State Representation.


6. **Route Planner**

- Description: 

    - Built a route planner application that plans optimal routes for cars, bikes, and pedestrians.

    - Designed a graph data structure to process map data from custom Node And Edge (NAE) files.

- Technologies: Java, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, PriorityQueue, Graph theory.

7. **Software Engineering Projects**

- Description: 

    - **Configurable Database**: Designed and implemented a configurable database, utilizing 3 different techniques: runtime parameters, decorators, traits and mixins, to learn about Scala's advanced language features.

    - **Type Checkers**: Developed standard and variability-aware type checkers for a custom programming language.

- Technologies: Scala, Eclipse IDE, Decorator pattern, Traits, Class composition, Mixins, Type checking, SAT solver (CafeSAT), sbt.

8. **Winter der Toten**

- Description: 
    - Collaborated with a team of 4 to design and develop a cooperative survival strategy board game.
